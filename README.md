# Chess Engine
RLHF based (maybe) 

trying some autoencoder based approches (might not work) and fine tuning it with RLHF<br>
A way for me to learn more about RLHF and maybe I write my own transformers from scratch (eventually))

might make a decentralized system out of it !

Beating the best chess system out there (alphazero maybe ??)
